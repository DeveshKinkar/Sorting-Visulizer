The “Sorting Visualizer” project is basically a web 
development project which is used to visualize the 
sorting algorithms and performs the operation of 
algorithms step by step as the algorithms works like 
Bubble Sort, Selection Sort , Merge Sort etc. We shuffle 
the bars in a random order that is in a unsorted order. We 
perform sorting algorithms on these bars to sort these 
bars in a ascending order by applying the different 
algorithms by clicking on the buttons of these sorting 
algorithms .
