INTRODUCTION
The “Sorting Visualizer” project is basically a web development project which is used to visualize the sorting algorithms and 
performs the operation of algorithms step by step as the algorithms works like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort , Merge Sort etc. We shuffle 
the bars in a random order that is in a unsorted order. We perform sorting algorithms on these bars to sort these bars in a 
ascending order by applying the different algorithms by clicking on the buttons of these sorting algorithms.

OBJECTIVES
The main objective of Sorting Visualizer project is to learn and visualize the sorting algorithms how these algorithms works We 
can see the steps of swapping or any divide and conquer part of these bars. Here 5 different types of sorting algorithms is used to 
visualize.
A visualization of data is implemented as a bar graph, after which a data sorting and algorithm may be applied .The resulting 
animation is then performed either automatically or by the user, who then sets their own pace.

FEATURES
• Visualize sorting part: Users can see the steps followed by these sorting visualizer as it contains five buttons of different
algorithms to sort the bars.
• Shuffle bars : Users can easily shuffle the bars in random order i.e. with small height or large height of bars. 
• User Friendly: It’s easy for users and quite simple to operate. • Ease of Use: Being user friendly environment it is very easy to 
operate by just clicking the button for the desired result. 
• Colours used: Colours should be used to show whether or not anything is being compared 
• Observe the swapping of bars: when a users apply any sorting algorithms by clicking the button than these bars start sorting by 
swapping according to their height.

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

Implemented algorithms:

Bubble sort
Selection sort
Insertion sort
Merge sort
Quick sort
Heap sort
Features:

Colored representation of step being executed. 1.1) Blue:default 1.2) Yellow: Being compared 1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved 1.4) Green: In correct position
3 Controls for visualizations 2.1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels) 2.2) Data size () 2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
